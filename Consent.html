<h2><center>Information sheet</center></h2>

<h3>Invitation to take part</h3>
<p>We invite you to take part in a research study that aims to further our understanding of how we understand language. Please read the following information sheet carefully. You can save a copy of this page for your records by clicking on <a href="https://a03.learningandinference.org/WrenCarver_InfoConsent.pdf" target="_blank" download>this link</a>.</p>

<p>The study is being conducted by student researcher Wren Carver (sc2077@sussex.ac.uk), and project supervisor Dr Sam Berens (s.berens@sussex.ac.uk). They are based within the School of Psychology at the University of Sussex (UK) and are happy to be contacted if you have any questions.</p>

<h3>Why have I been invited to take part and what will I do?</h3>
<p>In this study, we are investigating how psychological processes that are associated with learning and memory help us to understand written and spoken language. You have been selected to take part because you meet the inclusion criteria.</p>

<p>The experiment will last around 40 minutes. During this time, you will be asked to complete 3 different tasks, in a random order: </p>

<ul style="padding-left:20px;list-style-type:circle;"><!-- Start of list -->
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">In one task, you will be presented with a sequence of image pairs: one image on the left of the screen, and one image on the right. The images will be colourful kaleidoscopic shapes (like <a href="./Assets/ExampleShape.png" target="_blank">this example</a>), and identical pairs will be repeated a number of times. For each pair that is shown, you will be asked to choose one of the images using your computer mouse. A simple set of rules will determine which image is the "correct" choice in each pair, although you will not know what these rules are at first. Learning through trial-and-error feedback, your aim will be to consistently select the correct image in each pair.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Another task will have a very similar structure to the task described above. Here, you will also see a sequence of image pairs and will have to choose the "correct" image in each pair. However, this time, the correct image will <b><u><i>not</i></u></b> be determined by a hidden set of rules that you must learn. Instead, the correct image will simply be the image that was previously shown most recently in a different pair.</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">In the remaining task, you will be asked to read two short stories and answer questions about their content using your computer microphone. Your aim will be to answer the questions as fully and as accurately as possible.</li>
</ul><!-- End of list -->

<h3>What will happen to the results and my personal information?</h3>
<p>The results of this research will be written into a scientific report for an undergraduate dissertation and a publication, and will be presented to other research scientists during academic conferences. We anticipate being able to provide a summary of our findings on request from 1st June 2026. Please contact Wren Carver (sc2077@sussex.ac.uk) if you wish to receive a copy of this report.</p>

<p>Your anonymity will be ensured in the way described in the consent form below. Please read this information carefully and then, if you wish to take part, please sign to show you have fully understood this information, and that you consent to take part in the study.</p>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">I understand that my participation is entirely voluntary, that I can choose not to participate in all or part of the study, and that I can withdraw at any stage without having to give a reason and without being penalised in any way (e.g., if I am a student, my decision whether or not to take part will not affect my grades).</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">I understand I can request without penalty that my data be withdrawn and deleted even after the data collection is complete, any time up until the results are analysed (26th August 2023).</li>
